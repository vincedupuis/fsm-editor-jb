# Code Generation

FSM Editor for JetBrains IDEs generates source code with the **same `fsm` command-line generator** as FSM Editor for VS Code and for Visual Studio. The plugin doesn't reimplement code generation: it runs `fsm`, which it bundles, and shows the results in the IDE. The same templates therefore produce the same code from IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, Visual Studio, a terminal or a CI build.

## From the IDE

Run **Generate Code...** from the diagram toolbar (**Code**), the context menu of a `.fsm` file in the Project view, the context menu of the editor tab, or **Tools › FSM Editor**. A dialog asks for:

1. **The template**: the templates bundled with the generator (`ts`, `sml`), any `*.hbs` file of the project, or **Browse...**.
2. **The output folder.** Generated files are overwritten every time.

The last template, and the last output folder of each machine, are remembered.

The generator reads the files on disk, so open `.fsm` documents with unsaved changes are saved first (Settings › Tools › FSM Editor › *Save .fsm documents before generating code*). Machines used by submachine states are read and validated too, but only the chosen machine is generated.

Results:

- The **FSM Code Generation** tool window shows the command that ran, every file written and the problems. Click a problem to open the file at its line (a state machine opens in the diagram).
- Generation stops when the machine has validation errors. Nothing is written then, and a dialog says why.
- A notification and the status bar report how many files were written, and the new files show up in the Project view.

To generate on a key, assign one to *Generate Code...* in Settings › Keymap (search for "Generate Code").

## From the command line and builds

The bundled program is a standalone executable (no Node.js needed), in the `cli/<platform>` folder of the plugin's install directory. It's also published as an archive for Windows, macOS and Linux with FSM Editor for VS Code:

```sh
fsm "models/**/*.fsm" --template ts --out src/generated
```

Exit codes: `0` success, `1` errors in the machines or the template, `2` bad usage. Problems are printed as `file:line: severity: message`, which build logs and CI understand. To generate code on every Gradle build:

```kotlin
val generateStateMachines by tasks.registering(Exec::class) {
    inputs.files(fileTree("models") { include("*.fsm") })
    outputs.dir(layout.buildDirectory.dir("generated/fsm"))
    commandLine("fsm", "models/*.fsm", "-t", "ts", "-o", layout.buildDirectory.dir("generated/fsm").get().asFile.path)
}
```

## Which fsm is used

In this order:

1. The path set in Settings › Tools › FSM Editor › *fsm executable*, when set.
2. The executable bundled with the plugin (`cli/<platform>/fsm`, or `fsm.exe` on Windows), with its templates in `cli/<platform>/templates`. `<platform>` is `darwin-arm64`, `darwin-x64`, `linux-arm64`, `linux-x64` or `windows-x64`.
3. An `fsm` (`fsm.exe` or `fsm.cmd` on Windows) on the `PATH`, for example from `npm link` in a clone of FSM Editor for VS Code.

Set the option to use a newer generator than the bundled one, your own build, or when the plugin was built without the generator for your platform.

## Templates and the code model

Templates are Handlebars files, optionally with YAML front matter. One template writes any number of files per machine through `{{#file "path"}}` blocks. They can't run code: every helper is built into the generator.

The bundled templates, TypeScript (`ts`) and [C++17 for Boost.SML](https://github.com/vincedupuis/fsm-editor-vscode/blob/main/docs/CODEGEN.md#the-boostsml-template) (`sml`), writing templates for other languages (C#, C++, Java, Kotlin, Python...), the helpers, the code model the templates receive, and the execution semantics of the generated code are documented with the generator, in [FSM Editor for VS Code's CODEGEN.md](https://github.com/vincedupuis/fsm-editor-vscode/blob/main/docs/CODEGEN.md). Templates in your project are listed in the Generate Code dialog, so you can keep them next to your models.
